<h6>ABOUT</h6>

<p>The #313treeproject goals are to
<br>
1) locate & record the location of dangerous trees and limbs for city officials, neighborhood organizations, arborists and philanthropists
<br>
2) organize strategic actions so that resources, personpower and logistics can be efficiently managed
<br>
3) attract philanthropic contributions for low cost and free removal for those in need.
<br>
4) safely and efficiently trim or remove these trees by winter each year until all dangerous trees are handled.
<br>
5) utilize the remnants of these trees for compost, firewood, furniture and construction materials to support neighborhood sustainability while lowering the cost of future services.
